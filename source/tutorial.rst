Installing the Tools
====================

For Installation or Packaging, you'll minimally want :ref:`pip` and
:ref:`setuptools`, and in most cases, :ref:`virtualenv` (unless you're using
`pyvenv`_).

Additionally, for building wheels, you'll need :ref:`wheel`, and for uploading
to :term:`PyPI <Python Package Index (PyPI)>`, you'll need :ref:`twine`.

We recommend the following installation sequence:

1. Install :ref:`pip` and :ref:`setuptools`: [3]_

   If you have a :ref:`PEP453 <PEP453s>`-compliant Python 3.4, it may already
   have the ``pip`` command available by default (and setuptools will be
   installed as well), or it may at least contain a working `ensurepip
   <https://docs.python.org/3.4/library/ensurepip.html>`_. To install pip (and
   setuptools) using ensurepip, run: ``python -m ensurepip --upgrade``.

   Otherwise:

   * Securely Download `get-pip.py
     <https://raw.github.com/pypa/pip/master/contrib/get-pip.py>`_ [1]_

   * Run ``python get-pip.py``.  This will install or upgrade pip.
     Additionally, it will install setuptools if it's not installed already. To
     upgrade an existing setuptools, run ``pip install -U setuptools`` [2]_

2. Optionally, Create a virtual environment (See :ref:`section below <Creating
   and using Virtual Environments>` for details):

   Using :ref:`virtualenv`:

   ::

    pip install virtualenv
    virtualenv <DIR>
    source <DIR>/bin/activate

   Using `pyvenv`_: [5]_

   ::

    pyvenv <DIR>
    source <DIR>/bin/activate


3. For building wheels: ``pip install wheel`` [2]_

4. For uploading distributions: ``pip install twine`` [2]_


.. _`Creating and using Virtual Environments`:

Virtual Environments
====================

Python "Virtual Environments" allow packages to be installed in an isolated
location for a particular application, rather than being installed globally.

Imagine you have an application that needs version 1 of LibFoo, but another
application requires version 2. How can you use both these applications? If you
install everything into /usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages (or whatever your
platform’s standard location is), it’s easy to end up in a situation where you
unintentionally upgrade an application that shouldn’t be upgraded.

Or more generally, what if you want to install an application and leave it be?
If an application works, any change in its libraries or the versions of those
libraries can break the application.

Also, what if you can’t install packages into the global site-packages
directory? For instance, on a shared host.

In all these cases, virtual environments can help you. They have their own
installation directories and they don’t share libraries with other virtual
environments.

Currently, there are two viable tools for creating Python virtual environments:
:ref:`virtualenv` and `pyvenv`_. `pyvenv`_ is only available in Python 3.3 &
3.4, and only in Python 3.4, is :ref:`pip` & :ref:`setuptools` installed into
environments by default, whereas :ref:`virtualenv` supports Python 2.6 thru
Python 3.4 and :ref:`pip` & :ref:`setuptools` are installed by default in every
version.

The basic usage is like so:

Using :ref:`virtualenv`:

::

 virtualenv <DIR>
 source <DIR>/bin/activate


Using `pyvenv`_:

::

 pyvenv <DIR>
 source <DIR>/bin/activate


For more information, see the `virtualenv <http://virtualenv.pypa.io>`_ docs or
the `pyvenv`_ docs.


Installing Python packages
==========================

:ref:`pip` is the recommended installer, and supports various requirement forms
and options.  For details, see the `pip docs
<https://pip.pypa.io>`_.

Examples
--------

Install `SomePackage` and its dependencies from :term:`PyPI <Python Package
Index (PyPI)>` using :ref:`pip:Requirement Specifiers`

::

 pip install SomePackage           # latest version
 pip install SomePackage==1.0.4    # specific version
 pip install 'SomePackage>=1.0.4'  # minimum version


Install a list of requirements specified in a :ref:`Requirements File
<pip:Requirements Files>`.

::

 pip install -r requirements.txt


Upgrade an already installed `SomePackage` to the latest from PyPI.

::

 pip install --upgrade SomePackage


Install a project from VCS in "editable" mode.  For a full breakdown of the
syntax, see pip's section on :ref:`VCS Support <pip:VCS Support>`.

::

 pip install -e git+https://git.repo/some_pkg.git#egg=SomePackage          # from git
 pip install -e hg+https://hg.repo/some_pkg.git#egg=SomePackage            # from mercurial
 pip install -e svn+svn://svn.repo/some_pkg/trunk/#egg=SomePackage         # from svn
 pip install -e git+https://git.repo/some_pkg.git@feature#egg=SomePackage  # from a branch


Install a particular source archive file.

::

 pip install ./downloads/SomePackage-1.0.4.tar.gz
 pip install http://my.package.repo/SomePackage-1.0.4.zip


Install from an alternate index

::

 pip install --index-url http://my.package.repo/simple/ SomePackage


Search an additional index during install, in addition to :term:`PyPI <Python
Package Index (PyPI)>`

::

 pip install --extra-index-url http://my.package.repo/simple SomePackage


Install from a local directory containing archives (and don't check :term:`PyPI
<Python Package Index (PyPI)>`)

::

 pip install --no-index --find-links=file:///local/dir/ SomePackage
 pip install --no-index --find-links=/local/dir/ SomePackage
 pip install --no-index --find-links=relative/dir/ SomePackage


Find pre-release and development versions, in addition to stable versions.  By
default, pip only finds stable versions.

::

 pip install --pre SomePackage


Wheels
------

:term:`Wheel` is a pre-built package format that provides faster installation
compared to :term:`Source Distributions (sdist) <Source Distribution (or
"sdist")>`, especially when a project contains compiled extensions.

As of v1.5, :ref:`pip` prefers :term:`wheels <Wheel>` over :term:`sdists <Source
Distribution (or "sdist")>` when searching indexes.

Although wheels are `becoming more common <http://pythonwheels.com>`_ on
:term:`PyPI <Python Package Index (PyPI)>`, if you want all of your dependencies
converted to wheel, do the following (assuming you're using a :ref:`Requirements
File <pip:Requirements Files>`):

::

 pip wheel --wheel-dir=/local/wheels -r requirements.txt

And then to install those requirements just using your local directory of wheels
(and not from PyPI):

::

 pip install --no-index --find-links=/local/wheels -r requirements.txt


:term:`Wheel` is intended to replace :term:`Eggs <Egg>`.  For a detailed
comparison, see :ref:`Wheel vs Egg`.


User Installs
-------------

To install packages that are isolated to the current user, use the ``-user`` flag:

::

  pip install --user SomePackage


For more information see the `User Installs
<https://pip.readthedocs.org/en/latest/user_guide.html#user-installs>`_ section
from the pip docs.



Creating your own Project
=========================

In the sections below, we'll reference the `PyPA sample project
<https://github.com/pypa/sampleproject>`_. which aims to exemplify best
practices for packaging Python projects using :ref:`setuptools`.


Layout
------

The critical requirement for creating projects using :ref:`setuptools` is to
have a ``setup.py``. For an example, see `sampleproject/setup.py
<https://github.com/pypa/sampleproject/blob/master/setup.py>`_.  We'll cover the
components of ``setup.py`` in the sections below.

Although it's not required, most projects will organize the code using a `single
top-level package <https://github.com/pypa/sampleproject/tree/master/sample>`_,
that's named the same as the project.

Additionally, most projects will contain the following files:

* A `README <https://github.com/pypa/sampleproject/blob/master/README.rst>`_ for
  explaining the project.
* A `setup.cfg <https://github.com/pypa/sampleproject/blob/master/setup.cfg>`_
  that contains option defaults for ``setup.py`` commands.
* A `MANIFEST.in
  <https://github.com/pypa/sampleproject/blob/master/MANIFEST.in>`_ that defines
  the files that will be included in the project distribution when it's
  packaged.


Name
----

from `sampleproject/setup.py
<https://github.com/pypa/sampleproject/blob/master/setup.py>`_

::

  name = 'sample'

This will determine how your project is listed on :term:`PyPI <Python Package
Index (PyPI)>`. For details on permitted characters, see the `name
<http://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0426/#name>`_ section from :ref:`PEP426
<PEP426s>`.


Version
-------

from `sampleproject/setup.py
<https://github.com/pypa/sampleproject/blob/master/setup.py>`_

::

  version = '1.2.0'


Projects should aim to comply with the `version scheme
<http://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0440/#public-version-identifiers>`_
specified in :ref:`PEP440 <PEP440s>`.  Here are some examples:

::

  1.2.0.dev1  # Development release
  1.2.0a1     # Alpha Release
  1.2.0b1     # Beta Release
  1.2.0rc1    # RC Release
  1.2.0       # Final Release
  1.2.0.post1 # Post Release

If the project code itself needs run-time access to the version, the simplest way is to keep the version in both
``setup.py`` and your code. If you'd rather not duplicate the value, there are a few ways to manage this. See the
":ref:`Single sourcing the version`" Advanced Topics section.

Packages
--------

Metadata
--------

Dependencies
------------

from `sampleproject/setup.py
<https://github.com/pypa/sampleproject/blob/master/setup.py>`_

::

 install_requires = ['peppercorn']

"install_requires" should be used to specify what dependences a project
minimally needs to run. When the project is installed by :ref:`pip`, this is the
specification that is used to install it’s dependencies.

For more on using "install_requires" see :ref:`install_requires vs Requirements files`.

Package Data
------------

from `sampleproject/setup.py
<https://github.com/pypa/sampleproject/blob/master/setup.py>`_

::

 package_data={
     'sample': ['package_data.dat'],
 }


Often, additional files need to be installed into a package. These files are
often data that’s closely related to the package’s implementation, or text files
containing documentation that might be of interest to programmers using the
package. These files are called "package data".

The value must be a mapping from package name to a list of relative path names
that should be copied into the package. The paths are interpreted as relative to
the directory containing the package.

For more information, see `Including Data Files
<http://pythonhosted.org/setuptools/setuptools.html#including-data-files>`_ from
the `setuptools docs <http://pythonhosted.org/setuptools/setuptools.html>`_.


Data Files
----------

from `sampleproject/setup.py
<https://github.com/pypa/sampleproject/blob/master/setup.py>`_

::

    data_files=[('my_data', ['data/data_file'])],

Although configuring ``package_data`` is recommended, in some cases you may need
to place data files outside of your packages.  This directive allows you to do
that.

Each (directory, files) pair in the sequence specifies the installation
directory and the files to install there. If directory is a relative path, it is
interpreted relative to the installation prefix (Python’s sys.prefix for
pure-Python packages, sys.exec_prefix for packages that contain extension
modules). Each file name in files is interpreted relative to the ``setup.py`` script
at the top of the package source distribution.

For more information see the distutils section on `Installing Additional Files
<http://docs.python.org/3.4/distutils/setupscript.html#installing-additional-files>`_.

.. note::

  :ref:`setuptools` allows absolute "data_files" paths, and pip honors them as
  absolute, when intalling from :term:`sdist <Source Distribution (or
  "sdist")>`.  This is not true, when installing from :term:`wheel`
  distributions. Wheels don't support absolute paths, and they end up being
  installed relative to "site-packages".  For discussion see `wheel Issue #92
  <https://bitbucket.org/pypa/wheel/issue/92>`_.

Manifest

Scripts
-------

from `sampleproject/setup.py
<https://github.com/pypa/sampleproject/blob/master/setup.py>`_

::

  entry_points={
      'console_scripts': [
          'sample=sample:main',
      ],
  },

Although ``setup.py`` supports a `scripts
<http://docs.python.org/3.4/distutils/setupscript.html#installing-scripts>`_
keyword for pointing to pre-made scripts, the recommended approach to achieve
cross-platform compatibility, is to use "console_script" `entry points
<http://pythonhosted.org/setuptools/setuptools.html#dynamic-discovery-of-services-and-plugins>`_
that register your script interfaces, and let the toolchain handle the work of
turning these interfaces into actual scripts [6]_.  The scripts will be generated
during the install of your package.

For more information, see `Automatic Script Creation
<http://pythonhosted.org/setuptools/setuptools.html#automatic-script-creation>`_
from the `setuptools docs <http://pythonhosted.org/setuptools/setuptools.html>`_.


Developing your project
=======================

Although not required, it's common to locally install your project in "develop"
or "editable" mode, while you're working on it.  This allows the project to be
both installed and editable in project form.

::

 cd myproject
 python setup.py develop    # the setuptools way
 pip install -e .           # the pip way (which just calls "setup.py develop")


For more information, see the `Development Mode
<http://pythonhosted.org/setuptools/setuptools.html#development-mode>`_ section
of the `setuptools docs <http://pythonhosted.org/setuptools/setuptools.html>`_.


Packaging your Project
======================

To have your project installable from a :term:`Package Index` like :term:`PyPI
<Python Package Index (PyPI)>`, you'll need to create a :term:`Distribution`
(aka ":term:`Package <Package (Meaning #2)>`" ) for your project.



Source Distributions
--------------------

Minimally, you should create a :term:`Source Distribution <Source Distribution (or
"sdist")>`:

::

 python setup.py sdist


A "source distribution" is unbuilt (i.e, it's not a :term:`Built Distribution`),
and requires a build step when installed by pip.  Even if the distribution is
pure python (i.e. contains no extensions), it still involves a build step to
build out the installation metadata from "``setup.py``".

.. _`Universal Wheels`:

Universal Wheels
----------------

Additionally, if your project is pure python (i.e. contains no compiled
extensions) and is version agnostic, then you should also create what's called a
"Universal Wheel". This is a wheel that can be installed anywhere by :ref:`pip`.

To build a Universal Wheel:

::

 python setup.py bdist_wheel --universal


You can also permanently set the ``--universal`` flag in "setup.cfg" (e.g., see
`sampleproject/setup.cfg
<https://github.com/pypa/sampleproject/blob/master/setup.cfg>`_)

::

 [bdist_wheel]
 universal=1


Only use the ``--universal`` setting, if:

1. Your project runs on Python 2 and 3 with no changes (i.e. it does not
   require 2to3).
2. Your project does not have any C extensions.

Beware that ``bdist_wheel`` does not currently have any checks to warn you if
use the setting inappropriately.

If your project has optional C extensions, it is recommended not to publish a
universal wheel, because pip will prefer the wheel over a source installation,
and prevent the possibility of building the extension.


Platform Wheels
---------------

"Platform Wheels" are wheels that are specific to a certain platform like linux,
OSX, or Windows, usually due to containing compiled extensions.

"Platform Wheels" are built the same as "Universal Wheels", but without the
``--universal`` flag:

::

 python setup.py bdist_wheel


.. note::

  :term:`PyPI <Python Package Index (PyPI)>` currently only allows uploads of
  platform wheels for Windows and OS X, NOT linux.  Currently, the wheel tag
  specification (:ref:`PEP425 <PEP425s>`) does not handle the variation that can
  exist across linux distros.


Uploading your Project to PyPI
==============================

First, register your package on PyPI:

::

  python setup.py register

The wizard will ask for your PyPI username and password (or let you create an
account). You will also be prompted to create a release password. A .pypirc
file will be created in your home folder.

Now upload your distributions

::

  python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel upload

You will be prompted for your release password.

This can also be done with :ref:`twine`

::

 twine upload dist/*


The Update Framework
--------------------

Your release password is used to create a private, offline key which authenticates
your releases using `TUF <http://theupdateframework.com/>`_. The key will be
stored with your local package source, and should never be shared online.

By default, your whole package is governed by this one key. For a large package
with many contributors, you may want to use the `TUF developer tool
<https://github.com/theupdateframework/tuf/blob/develop/tuf/README-developer-tools.md>`_
to manage release permissions for several offline keys.

.. [1] "Secure" in this context means using a modern browser or a
       tool like `curl` that verifies SSL certificates when downloading from
       https URLs.

.. [2] Depending on your platform, this may require root or Administrator
       access. :ref:`pip` is currently considering changing this by `making user
       installs the default behavior
       <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/1668>`_.

.. [3] On Linux and OSX, pip and setuptools will usually be available for the system
       python from a system package manager (e.g. `yum` or `apt-get` for linux,
       or `homebrew` for OSX). Unfortunately, there is often delay in getting
       the latest version this way, so in most cases, you'll want to use these
       instructions.

.. [4] For more information on creating projects, see the `Setuptools Docs
       <http://pythonhosted.org/setuptools/setuptools.html>`_

.. [5] Beginning with Python 3.4, ``pyvenv`` (a stdlib alternative to
       :ref:`virtualenv`) will create virtualenv environments with ``pip``
       pre-installed, thereby making it an equal alternative to
       :ref:`virtualenv`.

.. [6] Specifically, the "console_script" approach generates ``.exe`` files on
       Windows, which are necessary because the OS special-cases ``.exe`` files.
       Script-execution features like ``PATHEXT`` and the `Python Launcher for
       Windows <http://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0397/>`_ allow scripts to
       be used in many cases, but not all.
